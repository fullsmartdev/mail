To field gets a string.
To field parses an address list, gets the number of groups and addresses
For each group, create a Group parsing the string
  Group then creates an address for each address
For each address, create an Address parsing the string


so... need an address_list parser that splits up a list into an array of address nodes and an array of group nodes


Need to make an AddressLists class that takes a string, and returns the above output (array of addresses and hash of groups)

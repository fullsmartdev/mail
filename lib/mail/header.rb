  # Provides access to a header object.
  # 
  # ===Per RFC2822
  # 
  #  2.2. Header Fields
  #  
  #     Header fields are lines composed of a field name, followed by a colon
  #     (":"), followed by a field body, and terminated by CRLF.  A field
  #     name MUST be composed of printable US-ASCII characters (i.e.,
  #     characters that have values between 33 and 126, inclusive), except
  #     colon.  A field body may be composed of any US-ASCII characters,
  #     except for CR and LF.  However, a field body may contain CRLF when
  #     used in header "folding" and  "unfolding" as described in section
  #     2.2.3.  All field bodies MUST conform to the syntax described in
  #     sections 3 and 4 of this standard.

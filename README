Mail is an internet library for Ruby that is designed to handle emails
generation, parsing and sending in a simple, rubyesque manner.

The purpose of this library is to provide a single point of access to handle
all email functions, including sending and receiving emails.  All network
type actions are done through proxy methods to Net::SMTP, Net::POP3 etc.

All major mail functions should be able to happen from the Mail:: module.

For example, to send an email from your ruby application should just take:

 require 'mail'
 
 Mail.defaults({:smtp => 127.0.0.1})
 
 Mail::Message.send do
       from 'me@me.com'
         to 'you@you.com'
    subject 'Here is the image you wanted'
       body File.read('body.txt')
   add_file 'New Header Image', '/somefile.png'
 end

=Mail Development Road Path
-------------------------------------------------------------

==Basic Email Handling

* Everything so far [DONE - ML]

* Address parsing working with all TMail tests passing [DONE - ML]

* All address fields handling addresses correctly [DONE - ML]

* Mail able to instantiate on any known header type, use method missing [DONE - ML]

* Keywords and comments fields working (low hanging fruit) [DONE - ML]

* Date parsing working [DONE - ML]

* Date fields handling dates correctly [DONE - ML]

* Trace fields decided on method to handle [DONE - ML]

* Trace fields parsing correctly [DONE - ML]

* All trace field functionality working [DONE - ML]

* Message ID fields handling correctly [DONE - ML]

* Message ID fields generating correctly [DONE - ML]

* Work out basic API on address fields [DONE - ML]

* All RFC 2822 example emails passing [DONE - ML]

* All TMail tests relating to RFC2822 passing

* All RFC 2822 obsolete example emails passing

==Multipart Email Handling

 (need to break down into smaller steps when we get here)

* Initial stages of RFC 2045 implemented (content-type and 2046, 2047)

* Multipart/Report parsing done

* Multipart/Report reporting done

* Implement true "multicultralism" into Mail, get it handling the major types of incoming encoding, with view to handle any incoming encoding (make this easy to extend)

* Implement all helper methods on adding and deleting parts and attachments

==Basic Email Sending & Receiving

* Wrap up Net/SMTP [NF] (missing STMPS and Authentication Schemes support)

* Wrap up Net/POP3

* Provide SMTP/POP3/IMAP default configurations for all known webmails

* Wrap up Net/IMAP (if we really want to...)

* Get a mbox parser and handler written
